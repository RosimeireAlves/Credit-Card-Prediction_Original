# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This is to create models to detect frauds in credit card transactions using Deep Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Sampling techniques are implemented to tackle class imbalance problem. 

Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

******Production codes are updated for RF. ENJOY ðŸ’•ðŸ’•****** Note the preprocessors part of the pipeline are the same, so for the rest models, follow the same pipeline.
